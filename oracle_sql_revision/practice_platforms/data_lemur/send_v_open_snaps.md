## Task

Assume you're given tables with information on Snapchat users, including their ages and time spent sending and opening snaps.

Write a query to obtain a breakdown of the time spent sending vs. opening snaps as a percentage of total time spent on these activities grouped by age group. 
Round the percentage to 2 decimal places in the output.

### Notes:
- Calculate the following percentages:
  - time spent sending / (Time spent sending + Time spent opening)
  - time spent opening / (Time spent sending + Time spent opening)
- To avoid integer division in percentages, multiply by 100.0 and not 100.
- Effective April 15th, 2023, the solution has been updated and optimised.

### activities Table

| Column Name     | Type      |
|------------------|-----------|
| activity_id      | integer   |
| user_id          | integer   |
| activity_type    | string ('send', 'open', 'chat') |
| time_spent       | float     |
| activity_date    | datetime  |

### age_breakdown Table

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| user_id     | integer |
| age_bucket  | string ('21-25', '26-30', '31-35') |

### activities Example Input

| activity_id | user_id | activity_type | time_spent | activity_date         |
|-------------|---------|----------------|------------|------------------------|
| 7274        | 123     | open           | 4.50       | 06/22/2022 12:00:00    |
| 2425        | 123     | send           | 3.50       | 06/22/2022 12:00:00    |
| 1413        | 456     | send           | 5.67       | 06/23/2022 12:00:00    |
| 1414        | 789     | chat           | 11.00      | 06/25/2022 12:00:00    |
| 2536        | 456     | open           | 3.00       | 06/25/2022 12:00:00    |

### age_breakdown Example Input

| user_id | age_bucket |
|---------|------------|
| 123     | 31-35      |
| 456     | 26-30      |
| 789     | 21-25      |

### Example Output

| age_bucket | send_perc | open_perc |
|------------|-----------|-----------|
| 26-30      | 65.40     | 34.60     |
| 31-35      | 43.75     | 56.25     |

### Explanation

Using the age bucket **26-30** as an example:
- Time spent sending snaps = 5.67
- Time spent opening snaps = 3.00
- Total = 8.67

So:
- Send % = (5.67 / 8.67) Ã— 100 = **65.40%**
- Open % = (3.00 / 8.67) Ã— 100 = **34.60%**

### ðŸ§® SQL Query

```sql
with unified_time as (
  select
    age_bucket,
    sum(case when activity_type = 'send' then time_spent else 0 end) as time_spent_sending,
    sum(case when activity_type = 'open' then time_spent else 0 end) as time_spent_opening,
    sum(case when activity_type in ('send', 'open') then time_spent else 0 end) as total_time_spent
  from
    activities a inner join age_breakdown ab
    on a.user_id = ab.user_id 
  group by age_bucket
)
select  
  age_bucket,
  round((time_spent_sending/total_time_spent) * 100.0, 2) as send_perc,
  round((time_spent_opening/total_time_spent) * 100.0, 2) as open_perc
from unified_time;
```
