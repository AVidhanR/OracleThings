-- my approach
with shs as (
  select 
    nth_value(salary, 2) over (
      order by salary desc
    ) as second_highest_salary
  from employee
)
select distinct second_highest_salary
from shs
where second_highest_salary is not null;

-- simple approach 
with highest_salary as (
  select max(salary) as max_sal
  from employee
)
select max(salary) as second_highest_salary
from employee
where salary < (
