# IBM DB2 Query Usage Analysis (Q3 2023)

IBM is analyzing how their employees are utilizing the Db2 database by tracking the SQL queries executed by their employees. The objective is to generate data to populate a histogram that shows the number of unique queries run by employees during the third quarter of 2023 (July to September). Additionally, it should count the number of employees who did not run any queries during this period.

## üéØ Objective

Display the number of unique queries as histogram categories, along with the count of employees who executed that number of unique queries.

### üßÆ SQL Query

```sql
with unique_queries_analytics as (
  select
    e.employee_id,
    count(q.query_id) as unique_queries
  from
    queries q right join employees e
    on (q.employee_id = e.employee_id) and 
    extract(year from q.query_starttime) = 2023 and 
    extract(month from q.query_starttime) in (7, 8, 9)
  group by e.employee_id
)
select  
  unique_queries,
  count(employee_id) as employee_count
from unique_queries_analytics
group by unique_queries
order by unique_queries asc;
```
